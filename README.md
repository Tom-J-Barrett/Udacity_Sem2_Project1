# Udacity_Sem2_Project1

This repo consists of a notebook containing code for the first project of Semster 2 in the Udacity Data Science course.

This project is titled 'Write A Data Science Blog Post'.

The [Stack Overflow 2017 survey](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) data was used here in order to glean some information on professional developers and what to focus on to have the best career.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook running Python 3 with the libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. These can be installed using pip but should be included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project was written as part of the Udacity Become a Data Scientist course. I used the Stack Overflow survey data due to my interest in professional software developers.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Project1.ipynb contains the Python code for this project.
It assumes that the survey data is in the same directory.
This can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017 . 

## Results <a name="results"></a>
Throughout the notebook, I set out to answer three questions:
 
1. What are the most common languages, technologies, methodologies and tools used by professionals 
2. What is the average salary for each programming language
3. Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction

We found out the following:

* JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL and Python are the most used languages by professional developers and therefore would be the most in demand and transferable skill between jobs. To support this, the most used frameworks are mostly JavaScript based. Agile is also the most popular methodology used by professional developers.

* Languages that are known and used by less professionals warrant higher salaries.

* Those who use less popular languages have higher job satisfaction but this may be a correlation between salary and job satisfaction.

## Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>
Must acknowledge Stack Overflow and Kaggle for the data, whose licensing can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017). 
Guidance on implementing the notebook and README were taken from learnings in the Udacoty course. The sole author of the code was Tom Barrett.
